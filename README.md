# About
The app uses Google's Dialogflow API to create an artificial intelligence (AI) voice chat interface in the browser. The app will listen to the userâ€™s voice and reply with a synthetic voice.

Right now the app is only programmed to handle small talk but with handy tools in the Dialogflow GUI can be programmed to handle anything from task reminders to banking transactions.
